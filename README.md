# arogya_tech

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for Arogya Tech


Things that make this version standout-
1.Code is optimised, readable and modular.
2.Have integrated features like tooltip and error display to make user experience better.
3.Ux has been prioritized instead of Ui for now.
4.Have been tested for most device sizes.
5.Proper structuring is done.
6.Nomenclature and norms have been followed.



I would like to mention some pointers that couldn't be achieved due to lack of time.These pointers are only
considering these two pages and not assuming the work done on others:
1.Test Cases, this we can hire an intern to achieve.Ensures quality.
2.We can build an overall better Ui.Although the Ux is nice.
3.We can integrated a message to the registered phone number after appointment booking as
  well as an automated call as a reminder on the previous day and the day of booking.
4.We can allow the user to use pre-used details to register a patient.
5.Design colors can be improved.
6.Could add firebase data analyst on every click and text box to monitor time spend.
7.Language and theme always comes in handy.Where the app's language is the phone's
  and the theme- light or dark depending on the phone.Could allow the user to switch but 
  first values would be system based.
8. Could add voice over guide for better understanding and sounds for better engagement. 
6.Page Appointments-
  1.Should have marked sunday absent, considering the time slots.
  2.Ui could be better when it comes to the tips
  3.The tips will only be shown to a user for the first time, that needs authentication
    which we haven't yet integrated into this.
  4.The hour scroll bar, that I'll prefer defining in the interview
  5.There are more spaces than the design in this because of the tips integrated later.
    Could lessen the spaces later.
  6.Haven't integrated Lato, font family.
  7.Have stuck to the design but taken independence of changing design dimensions or 
    weights, in case if they didn't look good.
 3.Page Patients Registration -
 1. Have used flutter toast for error display.Could explore options like bottom sheet & snackbar.
 2. Could allow a click over appointment details to show more details of the appointment
    and click over doctor for the doc's profile.
 3. Haven't used tool tip here as already integrated earlier.
 4. Could allow a text box to appear on clicking others, so that the person can fill
    up their preferred gender, considering there are many right now.
 5. Could make the waiting circular bar, better, display facts or some trivia.


Points to keep in mind:
1.The patient display Api doesn't always show booked patients even after the appointment is booked.
  Due to that, haven't tested some parts but mostly, it might not have a bug.
2.App has been tested on several devices, still not enough.Hence, there might be some
  overflow etc error.Rare chances, but possible.
